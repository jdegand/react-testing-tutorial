# React Testing Tutorial

Completed Result from [Codevolution React Testing Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2sv8jXoP4s&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwirqe1KHFCHJ0RqNuN61SJd&index=1)

## Thoughts

- Skipped some early videos. Too basic and drawn out.  
- npm run coverage / npm run lint
- Cypress recommends data-testids as first choice for selectors 
- RTL recommends them as a last resort
- Without authentication, this was pretty basic but it did clarify a few mistakes I was making with RTL
- Didn't bother with husky etc
